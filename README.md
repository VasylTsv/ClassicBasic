# ClassicBasic
Basic interpreter compatible with old school interpreters

This is a barebone Basic interpreter with high degree of compatibilty with the original MS Basic and similar language variants from 70s and 80s. It was written as a part of a programming challenge at work and as such took a couple of evenings. The code may not be very clean or well commented, but it is completely functional. As part of the challenge, it was expected to run a couple programs from old books (one by David Ahl and one by Tim Hartnell), it would probably run most if not all programs from the classic Basic books of the era, as long as those don't use graphics or sound (these features where never portable or well defined). It is not intended for any practical use but who knows, there may be something. It was also a neat challenge, I had a lot of fun writing this interpreted from the scratch (I intentionally did not use any other implementations to get any ideas).
There is a build.bat file that allows compiling the interpreter from the Visual Studio command line (VS2019 and VS2022 tested). No other compilers were tested.
